.SH NAME
.PP
gh-extension-search - Search extensions to the GitHub CLI


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBgh extension search [<query>] [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Search for gh extensions.

.PP
With no arguments, this command prints out the first 30 extensions
available to install sorted by number of stars. More extensions can
be fetched by specifying a higher limit with the \fB--limit\fR flag.

.PP
When connected to a terminal, this command prints out three columns.
The first has a ✓ if the extension is already installed locally. The
second is the full name of the extension repository in \fBOWNER/REPO\fR
format. The third is the extension's description.

.PP
When not connected to a terminal, the ✓ character is rendered as the
word "installed" but otherwise the order and content of the columns
are the same.

.PP
This command behaves similarly to \fBgh search repos\fR but does not
support as many search qualifiers. For a finer grained search of
extensions, try using:

.EX
gh search repos --topic "gh-extension"

.EE

.PP
and adding qualifiers as needed. See \fBgh help search repos\fR to learn
more about repository search.

.PP
For listing just the extensions that are already installed locally,
see:

.EX
gh ext list
