.SH NAME
.PP
gh-extension - Manage gh extensions


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBgh extension [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
GitHub CLI extensions are repositories that provide additional gh commands.

.PP
The name of the extension repository must start with \fBgh-\fR and it must contain an
executable of the same name. All arguments passed to the \fBgh <extname>\fR invocation
will be forwarded to the \fBgh-<extname>\fR executable of the extension.

.PP
An extension cannot override any of the core gh commands. If an extension name conflicts
with a core gh command, you can use \fBgh extension exec <extname>\fR\&.

.PP
For the list of available extensions, see
