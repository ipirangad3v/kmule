.SH NAME
.PP
gh-auth-refresh - Refresh stored authentication credentials


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBgh auth refresh [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Expand or fix the permission scopes for stored credentials.

.PP
The \fB--scopes\fR flag accepts a comma separated list of scopes you want
your gh credentials to have. If no scopes are provided, the command
maintains previously added scopes.

.PP
The \fB--remove-scopes\fR flag accepts a comma separated list of scopes you
want to remove from your gh credentials. Scope removal is idempotent.
The minimum set of scopes (\fBrepo\fR, \fBread:org\fR, and \fBgist\fR) cannot be removed.

.PP
The \fB--reset-scopes\fR flag resets the scopes for your gh credentials to
the default set of scopes for your auth flow.
